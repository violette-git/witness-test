# Transparency Giving App (witness)
---
## **Overview**
---
Churches and Non-Profit Orginizations have always been vulnerable to fraud, but the transition into the information age has pushed this crime into the sunlight quite often over the past decade.

Whether it be an Usher scraping off the top, The Bookkeeper issuing checks to fake companies, or The Pastor using your hard earned money on his new car. ***All the while, that church goal is still unmet.*** 

This app aims to cut the fraud out before it begins and shine a light into your community, reinforcing a trust in the communities we serve.
